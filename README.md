Image Board
=========================

Like Instagram web site where you can upload photos or images, see all previously uploaded pictures, write comments and so on. My personal goal in this project was to work more with **CSS** and **Responsive Design** and to make it look like it should to. Image Board builded in **Backbone** with a lot of **JQuery**

* This is the homepage where you can see 6 previously uploaded pictures, button "download more" which dowloads 6 images more and after that **infinite scroll** comes on board.

* You can see some info about the picture by move your mouse on it

* Single image view where you can see all information about this picture, leave your comment, read previous comments, give like(or unlike if you already liked it)
